## Adding new packages

#### Create a new package

create a new folder inside the `packages` folder and run

```bash
yarn init
```

and fill the package information.

#### Create the package scripts

After that, create in the package's `package.json` file the above scripts.

This enable us to run all packages commands from the root folder.

#### Register the new package

Add the created package in the root `package.json` workspaces array

```json
{
"workspaces": [
    "packages/natds-themes",
    "packages/<your-new-package>"
  ]
}
```

#### Adding dependencies to a package

from the root folder

```shell
npx lerna add <package-I-want-to-add> --scope @naturacosmeticos/<my-package> -D
```

#### Adding shared dependencies to all packages

from the root folder (devDependencies only. if it is a **dependency**, it should be added and listed in the packages `package.json` with the above command)

```shell
yarn add <package-I-want-to-add> -D -W
```

#### Start hacking!

## Commiting

We are using the `conventional commits` guidelines to automate our versioning and changelog criation process.

You can read more about [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

If you are unsure about how to follow the commit guidelines, we have an interective guide to help you with this. See the `commit` command above.

> All the commits have to contain an issue number starting with `DSY-`. If you are having trouble commiting (reference error) you probably forgot that! Using the `commit` command, you can include this information on the long description field
